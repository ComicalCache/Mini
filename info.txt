Run Mini with a file(path) argument to open or create a file or a directory to open it in the file browser. Omit the
file(path) to create a "scratchpad" buffer with no backing file. A few things that make Mini interesting: it has
line-numbers, diffed-rendering, undo and redo, contains a file browser, allows for multiple buffers to be opened
simultaneously and lets you run terminal commands.

> If you're in Mini, press 'J'/'K' to scroll or 'Y' to yank the message into the clipboard.

Mini should feel familiar to those who have used VIm before. It features two kinds of buffers: a text buffer and a file
browser buffer. You can navigate and manipulate buffers using "motions". Both buffers support these basic motions:
- 'h' | 'j' | 'k' | 'l' to move the cursor
- 'H' | 'J' | 'K' | 'L' to shift the viewport
- 'w' to skip to the next word
- 'W' to skip to the end of the next word
- 'b' to go back one word
- 'B' to go back to the end of the previous word
- 's' to skip to the next whitespace
- 'S' to go back to the previous whitespace
- '}' to skip to the next empty line
- '{' to go to the previous empty line
- '<' | '>' to jump to the beginning/end of a line
- '.' to jump to the matching opposite bracket
- 'g' to go to the end of the file
- 'G' to go to the start of the file
- 'v' to start a selection. A selection marks a character and selects the text "between" the selected character and the
    current cursor position. This is visualized through highlighting the selected area.
- 'V' to start line selection
- 'esc' remove all selections
- 'y' + motion to yank characters that would be skipped by the motion to the clipboard
- 'yy' to yank a line to the clipboard
- 'n' to jump to the next search match
- 'N' to jump to the previous search match

> Selections can be "paused" by pressing 'v' or 'V' again. The selection will remain but the cursor can be moved freely
> without modifying the selection. Pressing 'v' or 'V' will start a new separate selection, allowing for multiple
> selections at the same time. 'Esc' will always remove all selections.

Furthermore, you can enter command mode by pressing space. Using the up and down arrow you can cycle through the issued
command history. Both buffers support following commands:
- '?' to see this message
- 'j <line>:<column>' to jump to an absolute line number and column. If the column is omitted it jumps to the
    beginning of the line. If the line is missing it jumps to the column in the current line. Particularly ':' does
    nothing.
- 's /<regex>/' to search text. If text was selected, it will only search in that selection. See
    https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/index.html for information about the regex syntax.
- 'lb' lists all opened buffers
- 'cb <idx>' changes buffer to the buffer at index <idx>
- 'nb <kind>' creates a new buffer of kind <kind>. Available kinds are 'Text'/'T' and 'Files'/'F'.
- 'log' writes a log of all error messages since last log to 'mini.log'. The file houses in the directory where Mini was
    initially opened.

If the entered command results in an error, an error message is shown. To dismiss the message press any button besides
the following that have special meaning:
- 'J' to scroll the error message down
- 'K' to scroll the error message up
- 'Y' to yank the error message to the clipboard

Text Buffer:
This is probably the most important buffer. It contains the editor window where you can edit your files and is the
buffer that you'll be presented with when opening the editor. It has three modes: view mode, input mode, and command
mode.
    View Mode:
    View mode is the default mode when opening Mini or the text buffer. In view mode you can use the common motions to
    navigate or any of the following to manipulate the buffer:
    - 'x' to delete the character under the cursor
    - 'd' + motion to delete characters that would be skipped by the motion
    - 'dd' to delete a line
    - 'c' + motion to change characters that would be skipped by the motion
    - 'cc' to change a line
    - 'r' + char to replace the character under the cursor
    - 'p' to paste the clipboard at the cursor
    - 'P' to paste the clipbiard in a new line above the cursor. If the clipboard contents have a trailing '\n', it
        won't be written.
    - 'u' to undo the last modification
    - 'U' to redo the last modification

    Additionally you can start a selection and press 'dv' or 'cv' to delete or yank the selection respectively.

    Insert Mode:
    Insert mode is the mode where you can input text and manipulate the buffer this way, analog to VIm's insertion mode.
    You can enter insert mode by pressing any of the following motions and exit it using the escape key:
    - 'i' to enter insert mode
    - 'a' to enter insert mode one character after the current
    - 'A' to enter insert mode at the end of the line
    - 'o' to enter insert mode one line under the current
    - 'O' to enter insert mode one line above the current
    - 'esc' to exit insert mode

    Additionally you can use the arrow keys to move the cursor, or alt + '←' or alt + '→' to skip words in the
    respective direction.

    Command Mode:
    In command mode you can issue editor commands. You enter command mode by pressing space, typing in your command and
    hitting enter to execute it, or escape to abort. The following are valid commands:
    - 'q' to quit
    - 'qq' to force quit, discarding unsaved changes
    - 'w' to write the buffer to file
    - 'w <path>' to write this/all future writes to the specified path
    - 'o ?<path>' to open a file and replace the buffer (if the path is omitted a new "scratchpad" buffer with no
        backing file is created)
    - 'oo ?<path>' to open a file and replace the buffer, discarding unsaved changes (if the path is omitted a new
        "scratchpad" buffer with no backing file is created)
     - 'r /<regex>/<replace>/' to replace text. If text was selected it will only replace in that selection. See
        https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/index.html for information about the regex and replace syntax.
    - 'c <cmd>' runs the shell command <cmd> and appends the output to the end of the buffer. Input is passed through
        to the running shell command. 'ctrl+q' can be used to force-quit a running shell command.

Files Buffer:
The files buffer is a small file browser to browse directories, starting initially at the current path, and open files.
It has two modes: view mode and command mode.
    View Mode:
    View mode is the default mode when opening the files buffer. In view mode you can use the common motions to
    navigate or any of the following to manipulate the buffer:
    - 'r' to refresh the file list
    - '⏎' to open a directory or file
    - 'd' to remove the file or directory on the current line (see the 'rm' command bellow for more info)
    - 'D' to recursively remove the directory on the current line (see the 'rm!' command bellow for more info)

    Command Mode:
    In command mode you can issue editor commands. You enter command mode by pressing space, typing in your command and
    hitting enter to execute it, or escape to abort. The following are valid commands:
    - 'q' | 'qq' to quit to the Text Buffer
    - 'mk <path>' to create a file or directory. Use a trailing '/' to create a directory. Creates the needed directory
        hierarchy if needed.
    - 'rm <path>' to remove a file or empty directory. Use a trailing '/' to remove a directory.
    - 'rm! <path>' to recursively remove a directory and all of its contents. Use with caution! Use a trailing '/' to
        remove the directory and its contents.
